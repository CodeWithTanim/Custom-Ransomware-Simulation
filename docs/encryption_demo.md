# Encryption & Decryption Demo

## Encryption
- Uses `pyAesCrypt` AES-256 encryption
- Encrypts `.txt` and `.bin` files in the folder
- Key is stored in `key.key`

## Decryption
- Uses the same key to decrypt files
- Demonstrates full round-trip of encryption -> decryption

## Notes
- Only works on test files in `sandbox/`
