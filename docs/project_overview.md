# Project Overview

This project simulates ransomware in a **safe and controlled environment**.  
It helps students and developers understand how ransomware works and how to safely mitigate it.

## Workflow
1. Generate a symmetric key
2. Encrypt files in a controlled folder (`sandbox/`)
3. Save the key securely
4. Decrypt files using the same key

## Safety Precautions
- Always run in a sandbox environment
- Never encrypt system files
- Backup important data before experimenting
